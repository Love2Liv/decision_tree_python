# decision_tree_python
Implementation of a decision tree with python

This implementation is composed three files:

1) load_dataset.py, which loads the iris dataset and splits it into a 4 arrays (train, train_labels, test, test_labels)

2) DecisionTree.py, which implements the decision tree class, as well as the functions to compute the confusion matrix, the precision, accuracy, and others ...

3) main.py, which is used to train and test the iris dataset on the decision tree.
